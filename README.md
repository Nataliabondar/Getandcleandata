The script was created^ run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
